		<h3>Rules of "Conway's game of life"</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
			<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
			<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
			<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction</li>
